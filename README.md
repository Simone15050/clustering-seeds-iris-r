# Clustering Analysis on Seeds and Iris Datasets

This project was completed as part of my Introduction to Data Mining course at Fairleigh Dickinson University.

The goal was to explore unsupervised learning techniques using clustering algorithms on the Seeds and Iris datasets. The project focused on:

- Applying **k-means clustering** with both raw and standardized data
- Evaluating **cluster purity** using species/class labels
- Visualizing and comparing clusters using CLUSPLOT
- Running **hierarchical clustering** and **DBSCAN** on the Iris dataset
- Analyzing cluster statistics, cohesion, separation, and interpretation
